Automatic Sockets
Jerry Lee Williams Jr

Automatic Sockets let you use read from asynchronous sockets without
having to drive them yourself.

Use:
Create the AutoSocket.
Use Connect() to connect to the server.
Set up your callback in DataRecv.
Use Send() to send bytes.
Send(string) encodes the string in UTF-8 to send.
There is no Recv() because you will be notified.
Use Dispose() or Close() to close.
You can check the connection with Connected.
